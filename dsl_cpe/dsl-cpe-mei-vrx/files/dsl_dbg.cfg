# Configuration of initial common debug level for the DSL Subsystem startup.
#   xDSL_Dbg_DebugLevel
#     "" : Use value from system level configuration (refer to the config file
#          "/opt/lantiq/bin/debug_level.cfg" and the scripts that includes it)
#     "0": No special value (only depends on compile time settings)

# - This configuration value will only have an influence if the DSL subsystem
#   has been compiled to include debug symbols
# - It is highly recommended to set it at least to HIGH (3) to get errors if
#   possible from compilation point of view
# - This value is used both within API driver as well as control application
#   initialization and sets ALL available debug modules to the defined level
# - Due to the fact that the default UGW model selects the "Footprint"
#   compilation there is no risk to be flooded with any messages in general
# - Message dump (debug module DSL_DBG_MESSAGE_DUMP (12)) is only activated
#   if selecting "LOW" (1) - also refer to DSL CPE API UMPR for details,
#   chapter "Monitoring Messages Exchange"
